# Carbon Neutrality Simulation Dashboard

A web-based interactive platform designed to help Indian coal mines simulate and plan their journey toward carbon neutrality. The tool estimates emissions, evaluates carbon sinks, and simulates strategies like clean technologies, afforestation, renewable energy adoption, and carbon credit generation.

##  Features

-  **Mine Emission Estimation**  
  Calculates emissions based on input data (coal excavation, transport, equipment usage).

-  **Carbon Sink Estimation**  
  Estimates the carbon sequestration potential from afforestation or existing green cover.

-  **Simulation Dashboards**
  - **Clean Technologies** (Electric vehicles, methane capture, etc.)
  - **Afforestation Planning**
  - **Carbon Credit Calculation**
  - **Renewable Energy Alternatives**

-  **Emission Gap Analysis**  
  Compares emissions vs sinks and suggests required offsets.

-  **Data Visualization**  
  Graphs, charts, and comparative results for better decision-making.

- ðŸ’¡ **Scalable** for different mine types (Open-cast, Underground).
